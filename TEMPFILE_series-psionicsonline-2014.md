# Psionicsonline.net files 
*2014*
This is a notepad file for re-analysing psionicsonline.net (the main site only), which I ran into issues with early on in the indexing process.
This file is temporary, and will be deleted when its content is integrated back into the repository.
Some of these series may also be in [this file](./TEMPFILE_series-psionicsonline-2013.md), these files will be merged before this branch is committed to main.

**NOTE: Document numbers are for sorting only at the moment and will be changed once the rest of the repository adopts the numbering system.**
TODO: double check author names when importing these. Some of these were archived from other sites to PO and have different author names in the header and body.
